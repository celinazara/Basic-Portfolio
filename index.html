			<p>
				Hello! I'm Celina, I was born on a rainy day many years ago on April 7. While my name may sound familiar (i.e. Selina Gomez or Selena Quintanilla) I was not blessed with the singing skills that it is assoicated with. I prefer to listen and enjoy every music and limit my singing only for when I'm in my car or showering. </p>
	
			<p>	What I enjoy is (in no particular order and sometimes not at the same time):
				<ul>
					<li>Working out</li>
					<li>Dancing</li>
					<li>Reading</li>
					<li>Eating</li>
					<li>Watching boxing/UFC fights</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				If I'm not doing any of the above, I spend my time with my family, friends, and my two dogs that are the my joy.
